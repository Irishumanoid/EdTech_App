**Podcast Episode: Discovering Skills with Tessabell and Friends**

Welcome to "Adventure Waves," where Tessabell and her friends set sail on a houseboat journey to discover new skills! Today, we'll explore the art of rhythm while cruising the sunny waters.

As our houseboat gently glides along, Tessabell excitedly taps her drumsticks on the deck, creating a lively beat. "Let's make music with the waves!" she calls out. Her friends join in, clapping along as the ship becomes a floating band.

On the horizon, a tiny island appears, home to a mystical ranch where horses roam free. As the houseboat docks, the group disembarks to greet the playful horses. Tessabell brushes one, learning horse care vocabulary: "grooming," "tack," and "canter."

Suddenly, a drumming sound echoes from the woods. Intrigued, the group follows the rhythm to find a hidden percussion circle. They join in, drumming together and discovering the power of music and teamwork!
