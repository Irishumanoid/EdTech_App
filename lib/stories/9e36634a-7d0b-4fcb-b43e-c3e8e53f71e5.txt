Theo exclaimed, and with his ingenious mind, he quickly figured out how to rearrange the blocks into helpful stepping stones. Iris sprinted up the new path with ease, leading the way forward.

Next, they reached a tricky maze with riddles at every turn. Luna’s eyes sparkled, "Leave this to me!" She solved each riddle with lightning speed, carefully guiding Iris and Theo through winding paths.

Finally, they arrived at the last stretch where a mysterious map lay before them, hinting at a hidden route. With everyone's skills combined, they deciphered the clues, leading them through a stunning forest path glittered with morning dew.

As they burst through the final tape at the finish line, cheers erupted in the air! Iris, Luna, and Theo stood victorious, their hearts full of joy not just because they completed the Marathon Quest, but because they had done it together.
