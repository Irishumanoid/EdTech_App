Iris and Tessa were hanging out by the park when Iris had a cool idea—a secret adventure to the bottom of the lake! Not just any regular swimming trip, but one where they could use their love of running and technology. Iris, always bursting with energy, shouted, "Let’s create a special underwater running relay race!". Tessa's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Whoa! That sounds amazing, Iris! What’s the plan?"

Iris had been working on a neat gadget in her coding club. It was a small device that could transform running speed into energy, perfect for powering underwater gliders. "We can make it like a quest," Iris explained, tapping away on her laptop. "We'll set checkpoints under the lake. First, we run around the park to generate energy, then we swim down and find the hidden treasures!"

With a 'zoom' those words, the two friends dashed off towards Iris's house to gather materials. Tessa, who was an excellent swimmer, said, "I'll use my swim fins to catch up with the treasures, and with the energy from the running, we'll zoom underwater faster!" Iris giggled, "Perfect team! I’ll code the gliders to guide us with lights and sounds like this—beep-beep-beep!—when we’re near the treasures!"

Back at the lake, they stood on the shore with their waterproof backpacks, filled with snacks and each had a glider in hand. Tessa touched a button Iris had made, and the glider lit up with colorful lights in the shape of a friendly fish. "Let’s call this one Glider-Gill!" laughed Tessa. "Okay, team, ready, set, go!" shouted Iris and they sprinted around the park. Can you hear the footsteps? Da-da-da-da-da!

Watching their gliders fill up with energy, they dived into the lake. With each kick and stroke, Tessa felt the rush of water like a fish through seaweed. "Look!" Iris pointed, "There's one!" Following the glider’s beep-beep-beep, they saw a glowing treasure chest, filled with shiny stones that Iris had coded to glow when touched. Plink-plink!

As they collected their treasures, Tessa suddenly had an idea. "Hey, Iris, what if we code the gliders to leave friendly messages for other swimmers too? They can find inspirations just like we did!" Iris beamed, "That’s an awesome idea, Tessa! We’ll be like treasure-givers!"

Emerging from the lake triumphant, they stretched out on the grass, watching the sun begin its descent. "That was epic," said Iris, fist-bumping Tessa. "Next time, let's see if we can bring more friends and set up a big underwater relay!"

Tessa laughed, "Yeah—a massive splashy quest, with even more treasures to find!" As the sun set, the two friends dreamed of future adventures, full of running, swimming, and a dash of creativity!
