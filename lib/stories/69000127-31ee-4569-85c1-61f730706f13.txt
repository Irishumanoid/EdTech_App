Deep in the heart of Whispering Woods, Iris and Jacques uncovered a glowing map buried beneath a gnarled old tree. “Whoa, look at this!” Iris exclaimed, her eyes gleaming with excitement. The map showed the location of the fabled Words of Wonder, magical words that could make stories come alive!

Jacques, always ready for a challenge, said, “We’ve got to climb up Eagle Peak to find the first clue!” With a zoom and a swish, they darted through the forest, the trees whispering secrets as they passed.

At the base of the rocky climb, Jacques shouted, “Let’s do this!” They climbed hand over hand, the wind cheering them on. When they reached the top, Iris spotted a shimmering scroll tucked inside a crevice. “Look here!” she hollered, unfurling it. “The next clue is... ‘ephemeral!’ It means something that lasts a very short time. Just like our journey!”

Jacques nodded. “We must hurry to the Valley of Verbs before sunset!” And with that, they raced off, their adventure just beginning. Can you guess what happens next when they reach the valley? Perhaps you can imagine a magical word that would help Iris and Jacques on their quest!
