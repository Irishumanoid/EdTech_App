Welcome to "Adventures with Tessabell and Friends"! Today, we’re diving into a world of exploration that floats and gallops: houseboats and horse riding! Have you ever wondered what it's like to live on a houseboat? Join Tessabell as she sets sail on a river journey, discovering the different parts of a houseboat like the helm, where steering happens, or the galley, the houseboat's kitchen. 

Meanwhile, on the shore, Tessabell's friend, Max, is saddling up for a thrilling trail ride. Together, they'll explore a lush, forested path, listening closely to the rhythmic clop of hooves, and learning how to use reins to guide their trusty steed. 

In the crescendo of adventures, they all gather around to play drums on the deck. Feel the beat as they create a unique rhythm that echoes across the water. Let’s dive into this musical melding of land and sea with our imagination!
