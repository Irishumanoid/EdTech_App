**Episode Title: The Mystery of the Majestic Melody**

**Podcast Episode:**

Hey Tessabell and friends! Welcome to another episode of "Adventures in Discovery: Tessa’s World." Today, we embark on a journey right from the deck of a houseboat, cruising down the serene waterways. Tessabell, imagine the rhythm of the waves as the perfect backdrop to ride horses. How cool would it be to hear hoofbeats echo across the water?

As the sun sets, a mysterious melody floats over the breeze—a rhythm no drummer has heard before. Together, let's uncover this musical mystery! Is it the wind playing tricks, or could it be an enchanted drum a secret islander left behind?

To solve this, we'll need you to jot down the rhythm patterns you hear. Drum along on whatever surface you have near—maybe it's your knee or a pillow. Does it make you think of the clip-clop of horse hooves, or the gentle splash of our boat in water? Let’s combine these sounds and create our own boat-horse rhythm symphony! Ready to roll?
