Host: "Hey there, adventurers! Welcome back to 'Tessabell and Friends'—the podcast where we explore fun topics and learn new things. Today, Tessabell and her crew are setting sail on a sea of imagination aboard a magical houseboat!"

[Sound of gentle waves and seagulls]

Host: "Tessabell loves houseboats, and today, she's about to discover something extraordinary. As the boat glides across the water, Tessabell hears a soft drumming sound. Curious, she follows it to the deck and finds a dolphin tapping its tail against the side of the boat—just like Tessabell plays the drums!"

[Dolphin sounds and drumbeats]

Host: "Amazing! This friendly dolphin loves rhythm as much as Tessabell does. Together, they create a sea symphony. Meanwhile, Tessabell's friends are riding horseback along the shoreline, waving excitedly."
